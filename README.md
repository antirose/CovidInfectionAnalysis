# CovidInfectionAnalysis
A collaborative project looking into likelihood of infection between vaccinated and unvaccinated in the United States.




# Machine Learning Flowchart
•	Data Wrangling: 
Checkout data quality, sorting, filtering using PYTHON. 
•	working with missing data, outliers, reshaping data, calculating

Data Preprocessing
•	Preparing data for machine learning 
•	Importing libraries: pandas, NumPy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn.

Steps to run ML algorithm
•	Read dataset
•	Activate ML environment in jupyter notebook mlev
•	Data transformation
Find the null values- use dropna()
•	Convert strings to numbers using pd.get_dummies
•	Split the data into training and testing 

•	Try different Machine learning algorithm:
since our data is labeled, we use
•	Supervised learning 
we use: 
•	Decision tree using sklearn.tree.plot_tree
•	linear regression model
•	Evaluation metrics:
•	Confusion matrix
o	SMOTE/SMOTTEEN Oversampling

	-Data Wrangling: it is the process to gather, select, clean, structure raw data into the desired format for better decision.
    -Data imputation: It is the substitution of estimated values for missing or inconsistent data items. 
    In our case
    -we will use SUPERVISED LEARNING: It is an approach to create AI, program is given labeled input data.
    -We will focus on REGRESSION MODEL of supervised learning because the data is used to make predictions in a continuous form.
